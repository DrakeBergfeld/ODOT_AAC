Automatic Analysis Calculator for ODOT Summer Internship 2023

This project involved the pulling of data from a data collection of collisions. 
We pulled data from five years before and after doing work on the road. 
The objective was to see if we reduced collisions and reduced the severity of those collisions on those road strips. 
To do this, the other intern and I performed statistical analysis on the data set according to the Highway Safety Manual, using both the Shift-by-Proportions and Empirical Bayes methods. 
After performing this by hand, I then translated the process into VBA code in order to create a calculator that both performs the operation and interprets the results for the user. 

The resulting calculator can be found in this repository along with a sample data set to test on it.
